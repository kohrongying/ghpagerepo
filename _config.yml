# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
# Note that _config.yml changes are loaded at compile time, not runtime. 
# This means that if you’re running jekyll serve locally and you edit _config.yml, then changes to it won’t be detected. 
# You’ll need to kill and rerun jekyll serve.

  I like simple things and I am a tad bit weird. Just a tad bit. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
