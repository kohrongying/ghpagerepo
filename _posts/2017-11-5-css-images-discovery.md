!!! This is like one of my more exciting projects for me. Was in school studying one day when I came across this [medium article on CSS images](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-i-started-drawing-css-images-3fd878675c89). It was quite fun and I just wanted to try things out.

So it involved into a side project in which I aim to add one .. every week? Haha. I'm also trying to use this chance to learn some css/js tricks.This post is also meant to tell the story of how the pictures came about.

### Cactus
![Cactus](/assets/posts/cactus.png){:class="img-fluid"}

This was the first image I've worked on post-reading of the medium article. I liked cactus (!!! I have 3 pots at home and I water them once a week - is that sufficient?!). It was quite a good exercise when starting out. Due to the many spikes and dots, I utilised mixins! 

And this [color generating tool](https://coolors.co/) and [clippy](http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)!!

```
@mixin make-spike-tl($top, $left) {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: $dark-green;
    width: 12%;
    height: 2%;
    left: $left;
    top: $top;
}

.spikes-1 {
    @include make-spike-tl(0%,-5%);
}

```


### Washing Machine
I actually did this in the same day of cactus. Haha, it was to rebel against school work (capstone oops if you get what I mean). First image to use CSS3 animations, have to say its pretty neat of CSS3 to have basic animations like that! No need for js! 

```
.water-1 {
    animation: orbit 4s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes orbit {
    from { transform: rotate(0deg) translateX(110%) rotate(0deg); }
    to   { transform: rotate(360deg) translateX(110%) rotate(-360deg); }
}
```


### WE BARE BEARS !!!

BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CUTE?! SORRY THIS HAS TO BE IN CAPS COS I NEED TO CONVEY THIS PARTICULAR MESSAGE.

That being said, the arcs were very annoying. It was pretty much a trial-and-error thing. And learning about border-radius, having a difference wih % and px and how the 50%/50% thing came about. 

PS. Icebear for the win. 

### Turtwig

Go play Mystery Dungeon! This was so hard too, because of the particular shapes and the difficulty to create sharp edges... Turned out quite weird but that's the best I could do. Working on other Pokemon but I tell you it's hard, it gave me several roadblocks >< 


### Astronaut
![Astronaut](/assets/posts/astronaut.png){:class="img-fluid"}

LOL I took almost an entire day for this! Used HTML5 Canvas to create the background full of starss and a cool function I ripped off to create the auto-scrolling behavior. First image with javascript and I need to get used to the const and => functions haha. Also started to experiment with different css selectors like `div:nth-child(even|odd|n-1)`, `div:first-child`, `div:last-child`. It is really convenient! Looking forward to less tedius and more ingenious CSS tricks. Also loving the linear-gradient in CSS3 and used `box-shadow inset` to create the holes.  

And also wanted to do this astronaut, because I was inspired by 五月天 的 顽固, check out this Taiwanese BAND THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GENIUS AND their MVs always make me cry. It's a bid to persevere and don't let dreams die out! It's important to fight for yourself!

### Upcoming Ideas
- Incorporating Vuejs
- More CSS/JS animations
- More Graphic Designish things
