Okay so was working on improving the UI of the flexbox sandbox page when <!-- more -->I was like "Hm I want to have one column that spans two rows, I wish I had grid knowledge. Oh now might be a good time to learn CSS grids!"

Then I figured how ironic it would be to use CSS Grids to do the layout of a Flexbox Sandbox (LOL)

Okay some simple HTML code to help set up real quick.

```
<style>
.box { 
    padding: 20px;
    background: lightblue;
}
</style>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class='box'>A</div>
    <div class='box'>B</div>
    <div class='box'>C</div>
    <div class='box'>D</div>
    <div class='box'>E</div>
    <div class='box'>F</div>
</div>
```

Here's just the simple grid attributes you need to know for a basic understanding!
- grid-template-columns
- grid-auto-rows
- grid-gap
- grid-column-start/end
- grid-row-start/end

![CSSGrid1](/assets/posts/003.JPG){:class="img-fluid"}
![CSSGrid2](/assets/posts/004.JPG){:class="img-fluid"}

Well, that's all to know for a truly basic and 5 minute understanding of CSS grid. This is probably like hovering on the surface (shall not even attempt to say scratch the surface) so I'll see if there's a need for a more detailed one next time! Tooodlesss.
